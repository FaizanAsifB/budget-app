## About the project

![Budget App Preview](https://github.com/FaizanAsifB/Portfolio/blob/main/src/content/projects/project-images/budget-wide.jpg?raw=true)

The Personal Budget App is a significant undertaking that allowed me to grow my skills in React and frontend development. One of the primary challenges I faced was designing an intuitive interface that catered to users with varying levels of financial literacy. This required a deep understanding of React components and CSS (including SASS) to ensure the interface was not only user-friendly but also accessible. Through iterative testing and refining UI components, I focused on enhancing usability, ensuring smooth navigation, and presenting financial data clearly and effectively.

Another major challenge was implementing a robust expense tracking system. This aspect pushed me to learn advanced techniques in JavaScript and React state management to handle dynamic data within the application efficiently. Overcoming these hurdles significantly strengthened my technical skills and deepened my knowledge of frontend development practices. It highlighted the importance of meticulous planning, iterative development, and prioritizing user-centric design principles in creating impactful web applications
